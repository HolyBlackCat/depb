## depb

This repository contains scripts for building dependencies for this [simple game engine](https://github.com/HolyBlackCat/imp-re) of mine.

---

Note that the repository contains only makefiles, but not library source archives.

You probably want to grab [a release](https://github.com/HolyBlackCat/depb/releases) rather than cloning this repo. This way you'll get both scripts *and* library sources.
